# Hi there 👋

- 👨‍💻 I'm an AI/ML Engineer passionate about building intelligent systems and solving real-world problems through data.
- 🔬 Currently diving deeper into:
  - 🧠 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLMs, and Vector Databases
  - 🔄 Transfer Learning with LoRA & QLoRA
  - 🧭 LangChain, LangGraph, LlamaIndex and Agentic AI workflows
- ☁️ Leveraging AWS (SageMaker, Bedrock, Lambda) and Azure (AI Search, Cosmos DB) for scalable GenAI solutions
- 🤝 I'm open to collaboration on:
  - RAG pipelines, model fine-tuning, and GenAI agent architectures
  - AI for healthcare, renewable energy, and enterprise automation
- 📬 Reach out to me: **perlasaicharanreddy@gmail.com**
- ✨ Fun fact: Started with C++ code in a dorm, ended up deploying AI on Cloud.

I'm Charan, an AI Engineer with 5+ years of hands-on experience in developing and deploying machine learning and NLP pipelines across healthcare, energy, and enterprise domains. I’m currently wrapping up my Master's in Computer Science at the University of Cincinnati, where I specialized in Data Science and AI.

At **Siemens Digital Industries Software**, I led generative AI initiatives on Azure and designed RAG pipelines to automate domain model customization. I’ve optimized LLM-powered workflows using Postgres, vector DBs, and similarity search. My work on speech synthesis for Xcelerator Academy reduced manual video effort by 40%.

Previously at **Siemens Healthineers**, I built real-time anomaly detection platforms using federated learning, architected motion correction systems for medical imaging, and optimized NLP pipelines with 89% accuracy. I also contributed to enhancing test coverage and cloud-based deployment systems.

In my research stint at the **University of Cincinnati**, I built CNN/Transformer models for clinical imaging, boosting diagnostic accuracy, and used Spark+BERT to extract structured data from unstructured clinical notes.
